1.1 - 2011-02-10
----------------

   - New feature: Any FTI clone of FormSaveData2ContentEntry type can be
     selected in the save adapter as the data content entry type to use.
     This makes it possible to apply different workflows, content rules
     etc. to content saved by different forms. [saffe]


1.0 - 2011-01-06
----------------

  - New saved data adapter derives from large (BTree) folder instead
    of regular ones to handle better large numbers of contained items.

    the new BTree storage.
