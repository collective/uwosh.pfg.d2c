Changelog
=========

1.2.2 - 2011-03-03
------------------

   - Improved functionality for product developers: If user
     arrives to the pfg form via a plone content object,
     the referring content object is available
     as 'referrer' attribute of the event dispatched
     upon data entry content creation. [saffe]

   - Bugfix: anonymous TALES title override did not always
     work due to insufficient permissions. User is now
     elevated to "Owner" in the current context, allowing for more 
     useful TALES expressions. [saffe]


1.2.1 - 2011-02-24
------------------

   - New functionality for product developers: uwosh.pfg.d2c now fires
     a custom event upon a data content entry creation. Subscribe to:
     uwosh.pfg.d2c.interfaces.IFormSaveData2ContentEntryFinalizedEvent
     [saffe]

   - Improved documentation & Sphinx docs [saffe]

     expression configurable in the save data adapter. [saffe] [vangheem]

------------------

     [saffe]


1.1 - 2011-02-10
----------------

   - New feature: Any FTI clone of FormSaveData2ContentEntry type can be
     selected in the save adapter as the data content entry type to use.
     This makes it possible to apply different workflows, content rules
     etc. to content saved by different forms. [saffe]


1.0 - 2011-01-06
----------------

  - New saved data adapter derives from large (BTree) folder instead
    of regular ones to handle better large numbers of contained items.
    Upgrade step migrates from obsolete normal/slow folder storage to
    the new BTree storage.
    [nguyen]

  - fixed issue where it couldn't render the title viewlet if a
    lines field was used for the title field. Convert all value
    fields to string for the title.
